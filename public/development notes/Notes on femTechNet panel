Notes on femTechNet panel

- There is a great deal of firepower in the room
- Designing Culture is an extended med on relation btwn culture design innovation, etc
- The word feminist has already been used so much it has lost all meaning.
- What does feminism have to do with innovation, or technology?
	- I understand feminism and science but not the rest.
	- Still not a widely explored or understood topic
Note to Mary - Oh thank god you're also laughing.
-- first mention of kitchen, hands as digital devices. Sigh. Project in twenties.
- Technology must be understood as a symbolic object in our culture and not only a tool.
	- 1990 - Polytechnique grounds the speaker as the professor is hired to teach feminism. Badass. Scary.
	- Also the Oka crisis. MTL is still grounds for more violence than Toronto.
	- Now there's the Quebec Values charter, which is bleugh.
- a very respectable lady is talking about identity as an alternate possibility for collaboration.
- Asian parisienne says she missed the 1960s, and ended up marching for labour etc. instead. 
	- Joined in the 1990s. Had to think about sexuality and feminism.
	- God, I am so happy I can get married and never fucking talk about that in public any more.
	- Homesteaded in the internetz. Made it straight to Cyberfeminism.
	- Mainframe we assume is there, infiltrate things. Hacker mentality.

Sarah Diamond
	- talks about being a marxist feminist scholar with the tech impact on women's work
	- Tech is not neutral 
		- software systems are designed with understandings of the world which may be inaccurate.
	- the experiential practice of making is still educational no shit
- Discussion of the fetishization of the book by a shakespeare scholar
	- Protecting the integrity of Shakespeare Varieorum, which was crippled by being on paper.
	- So tech can be useful and some forms of knowledge are improved by it.
Asian Parisienne
	- Has shot back with the delights of abstraction and has alienated the panel
	- Go you, Asian Parisienne.
	- Social use of technology is mostly women and different communities

Anna Balsamo is asking a mean question about CYBERFEMINISM. Rude-polite tone! Quelle scandalle.
	- Homesteading and saying We're Here In Cyberspace
	- Things seem to be shifting now to the question of the social
	- Setting up a place is no longer an end in itself, but rather using network infra to enable diff sociality
	- Except it pretty much doesn't do that. It does the same thing we've always done, but faaaaster.
	- Overly concerned on women as protectors of social fabric

- Now into eWaste and coltran and the mines with the generally toxic implications, which are toxic in a really interestingly broad sense, which is interesting for telling stories more than on a practical level.
- Studio XX named a problem, not just a technology.
- important in terms of gender and culture

Sarah Diamond says social media is really interesting.
	- women in leadership positions are leading social
	- this is because social is still social.
	- unfortunately, social is a communications media governed by electricity, which follows the path of least resistance.
	- So resistance may not do great things for your volume. Unless you want to be known as an activist, which is its own flavour of sketchy-ass career.

Storming Wikipedia
	- Consciousness Raising Groups. Where's your women's group to tell you that you're right and they're wrong.
	- Trying to grasp the man-rage on the internet 
	- the need of the dudes to control the space to be affirming of his super manhood
	- Companion to the digital futures layout.
	- this is because people aren't being remembered at all, when they die, whatever.
	- These histories are not showing up in what is now the default cultural archive - Wikipedia.

- Oh this is about a distributed learning network. 
	- A syllabus that keeps with it all its links.
	- Non-answer for a non-question, really.
