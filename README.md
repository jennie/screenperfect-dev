# screenPerfect

screenPerfect serves paired client-control video via a NodeJS server installation to Chrome on desktop, and Android 4.1+ devices.

For actual frameperfect alignment via node and a wifi connection, check testbuffer.js; this is where all demo packages relating to timing are stored.

This presently works perfectly on a single machine, but is dodgy on mobile clients.
